I've made my first trip to NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference this year, to present some work with my collaborators Abdul Dakkak and Cheng Li. I've wanted to attend GTC ever since my first year in the IMPACT group, so this is an exciting trip for me!

![fast forward][ff] Here I am giving our fast-forward poster talk.
