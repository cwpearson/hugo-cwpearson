# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a member of the IMPACT Research Group led by Wen-Mei Hwu.

I am working on developing CAB (Cognitive Application Builder) as part of the joint UIUC / IBM C3SR cognitive computing systems research center. CAB will allow cognitive application developers to quickly write and debug high-performance scalable cogntitive computing applications.

I am also actively involved in high-performance application studies through the PAID-IME program and industry research collaborations with IBM and Huawei. The focus of these activities is to apply tools and techniques developed in the IMPACT group to improve the performance of real-world applications.
