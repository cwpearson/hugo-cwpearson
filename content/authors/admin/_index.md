I am a PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a member of the [IMPACT Research Group](http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/) led by Wen-Mei Hwu.

I am working on multi-GPU communication and scaling as part of the joint UIUC / IBM C3SR cognitive computing systems research center. The focus of these activities is to apply tools and techniques developed in the IMPACT group to improve the performance of real-world applications.
