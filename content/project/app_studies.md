I am part of the IME-Accelerators team for the NCSA PAID program. This program pairs domain scientists with computing specialists to improve effective utilization of the Blue Waters supercomputer at the National Petascale Computing Facility. I have worked on:

 - CUDA Kernel Optimization for [AWP](https://scec.usc.edu/scecpedia/AWP-ODC) with the Southern California Earthquake Center 
 - OpenACC Acceleration for [SETSM](https://u.osu.edu/setsm/) with Ohio State University  

I am also working on applying tools developed by the IMPACT research group to high-performance code in collaboration with Huawei.
