abstract = "Many scientific applications running on Blue Waters now include new versions of performance-critical code paths that are partially or completely GPU-accelerated. The PAID IME-Accelerators team has been engaged in a multi-disciplinary collaboration among domain scientists, application developers, and GPU performance experts to improve the use of GPUs on selected scientific codes on Blue Waters. This webinar describes the Accelerator team’s experience working both with CPU codes using accelerators for the first time and with optimizing codes with mature GPU implementations. The webinar will focus on collaborative strategies, the use of tools available on Blue Waters and in the IMPACT Research Group, performance results, lessons learned, and the impact to the science teams’ work."
